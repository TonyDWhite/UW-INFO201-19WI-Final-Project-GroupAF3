# **Gun Violence and Race Data Analysis**

## **What does this repo contain?**

This repository contains a gun violence data from 2013 to 2018, a 2017 race data, several data wrangling works, an github webpage, and a shiny app with interactive visualizations to provide few interesting insights with regards to the data.

## **Who creates this repo?**

We are a group of Info 201 students of Winter 2019, and this is our final project.

## **What information do the data provide?**
The first data contains the details about each gun violence incident in United States from January 2013 to March 2018. We are particularly interested in the state, casualities, and caliber columns.

The second data contain the ratios of race distribution in each state, including white, black, hispanic, and Asian, for year 2017.

## **Where do the data come from?**
The first data is originally from [Gun Violence Archive's website (GVA)](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/). It is a nonprofit corporation that provides free online accurate data on gun-related violence in the U.S. GVA collects comprehensive information, checks for accuracy, and publishes them online. Afterwards, we downloaded the data from a [gun violence repo by jamesqo](https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data/blob/master/README.md) who wrangled the data.

On the other hand, Kaiser Family Foundation estimated this second data based on the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. All numbers in this data is rounded to the nearest 100th, and all N/A data are those with relative standard errors greater than 30% to prevent biases. The link to the data can be found [here](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D).

## **How do we get the data?**
As for the first data, we directly clone the github repo. As for the second data, we download the .csv file from the link above.
